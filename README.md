# QKT-simulation

This is source code of my bachelor thesis on topic "Quantum Kicked Top simulation on IBM quantum computer".
It mainly focused on studying deterministic chaos in quantum limit.
Unfortunately paper wasn't published and i have no permition to publish it by myself, as it is property of university.
On this repository i will only shortly describe how posted code act.
